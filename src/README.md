# Poodle Search 

Demo here [here]()

This was part of a comapny coding challenge that I decided to replicate the popular search engine UI, have a guess which one that was. 

The serach querys an API that has a limited database of existing demonstration files. 

My aim is to imporve the UI and make is have almost all the feature that the inspiration search engine has at the moment. 

### Technologies used: 
- React, React Hooks, React Router 
- Axios for HTTP request 

The biggest challenge here was moving from Class based compoents to using Hooks and refactoring the code for it to work with the new useState() hook. In the end it seems a lot more intuitive and the redability is improved ten-fold in my opinion. 

It was fun to implement the loading screen and recreate the worlds most popular search engine. 

Hope you enjoy using the demo.

p.s. Don't be evil.
